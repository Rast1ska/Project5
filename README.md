# Project5
www.hackingwithswift.com

In this project, I learned a little bit more about UITableView: how to reload their data and how to insert rows. 
I also learned how to add text fields to UIAlertController so that you can accept user input. 
But I also learned some serious core stuff: more about Swift strings, closures, NSRange, and more.
